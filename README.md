# The open notebook of Bob Jarvis

These are my working notes as of early '22.  There will snippets of code, notes on projects, and general R&D.  

There WILL be spelling errors.  [Alot of errors](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html).  Information will move around, change, or disappear.  This notebook is backed up as a [Github repo](https://github.com/zealtv/notebook) and will hold a history of changes.
