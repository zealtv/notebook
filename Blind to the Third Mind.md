Tuning into the third mind.

We all have intuitive abilities, that although fuzzy and initially inaccurate, can be trained.  We have been blind to the third mind.

Our focus on specialisation (technique) has left our intuitive capacities to atrophy.  

Still, messages are passed through by our creative messengers, pulling from and contributing to our collective mind.

We can learn to tap in.  It can be learnt through targeted practice.

Transcend dichotomies. Separate and one.

The many become one and are increased by one.
