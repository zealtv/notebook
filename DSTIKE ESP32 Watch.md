Sold as the **dstike esp32 watch devkit**, this is an ESP32 microcontroller with an OLED display, a NeoPixel, flashlight, buzzer, battery, charging circuit, SD card slot, and a few buttons.

There are a few different versions, some in this watch form factor, some as single boards, different screens, ESP8266 etc etc.   Searching for *DSTIKE* should bring up some results.  These boards were designed for hacking WiFi networks, executing deauth attacks and such.

I'm interested in using the device as an OSC logger (and perhaps later playback) device, for capturing streaming OSC messages in on-body applications.

As of writing this, I have the device receiving a predefined OSC message and displaying it on the screen.
