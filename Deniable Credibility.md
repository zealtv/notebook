I have been trying out a thought experiment.  One where I look at dissonant points of view - and consider the truth of the various perspectives.

"Proof" is an interesting subject for this kind of consideration, in particular what constitutes proof of UFOs, UAP, extraterrestrials.  The proof that is released through the US government is often muddy, often paradoxical.  On one hand David Fravor's testimony is very believable in an intuitive, empathetic sense.  But the Gimbal footage isn't spectacular in anyway.  And it can easily be written off as lens artefacts, at least at a casual glance, and possibly even when subjected to deeper analysis.  There is something there for both audiences - the skeptics and the believers.  And you can sit in either camp, look at the same evidence and argue happily.

Compare that to the night-vision, triangle bokeh video.  That is clearly triangular bokeh.  No doubt about it.  Is there a UFO there?  Well only if it is flashing its lights at in the same pattern as aircraft navigation lights, and then filmed through lensing resulting in  triangular, green bokeh.  

What is interesting in both of these cases is both perspectives are reasonable, and could even be simultaneously correct.

Gimbal could be a UFO/UAP and could also show artefacts from mechanical optics.
The night vision triangle UFO/UAP could have been a UFO intentionally mimicking aircraft navigation lights and also exhibit lens artefacts.  

But that would be too wild of a coincidence to even consider, right?

This is a pattern that is common across UFO evidence, especially evidence from official sources, at various levels of arms-lengthness.  And viewing evidence through this lens, we can learn not only about the things that might be true in the evidence, we can also learn about the intentions of those altering evidence in order to stir up confusion, feeding meet to the skeptics, and kale to the believers.  A balanced meal.


I'm also interested here in the kinds of knowledge we consider as proof.  Analytical or intuitive.  Left brain or right brain.  Science or faith.  


I find this video fascinating in an intuitive way.  As someone who works with media art, music, timing, aesthetics.  There are some aspects of this video that are just so, so, sooo hard to fake.  Not that you can't do it, but the skills required are things like excellent acting, directing, and extremely high levels of creative energy.  These skills have a very high ceiling, and when you see highly accomplished work it has a wow-factor.

In this video, the parts that grab my attention are 
1.) the timing and delivery of the reaction "wow" at the end of the video. That shit is genuine.  And if it isn't, the film students who created this are phenomenal actors.  Good for them.  What are they doing now?

2.) The pattern the UFO makes in the sky.  It appears as interlinking, red lights, that rotate around a central axis and seem to drift in some sort of phasing relationship.  That shit is fucking GORGEOUS.  Real or fake - in either case - it is amazing.  

So the incongruence comes here again with the film students.  If I had a student who presented to me this video as an arts project, they would get high distinctions and I would specifically note the incredible detail in the animation of the red lights.    And I do not often see that sort of creative brilliance from students.  It literally inspires awe.  

I also link this sort of "demonstration of awe" in the UAP video with the orbs doing the dance.  Again - parts acting as a one. Music. Beauty. Awe.  Time phasing crops up in descriptions of entities movement in : [The Ariel Encounter](The%20Ariel%20Encounter.md)


Back to the jeruselum video... multiple angles, multiple videos, some clearly fake.  The murkiness emerges!

There is a give away that the most impressive of the angles has been digitally manipulated.  There are some mirrored, moving pixels, in the corner of the video.  The video has clearly gone through some sort of tracking and stabilisation process.  No doubt about it.

So where is the conflict in these perspectives?  We have digital artefacts that show it is doctored (thank you left brain), we have intuitions that suggest there is something real about these videos.  

The work of world class fraudsters?  Likely so.

Another non-responsive web presence, and non-active youtube channel is IvanXXX.  A channel that hosts the controversial skinny bob video.

Let's start with the skeptical view.  This video very much seems to use a post-processing, old-timey camera effect, with audio to boot.  I believe people have tracked down the exact plugin - and to me it seems quite evident just from inspecting the video.

So we can write it off immediately if we want to.

But let's entertain another perspective. What's so compelling about this video?  I'd suggest it is the fact the alien depicted is on the other side of the uncanny valley (thank you right brain).  Having grown up on Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal, and having worked on stop-motion animation myself, my perspective on this video is that if this is fake, it is world class work... that is then post-processed to show it is obviously fake.

Why go to that extra step?  If you have the worlds best animatronics or stop-motion artists creating this beautiful puppet, why not take go to the effort of shooting on film and then reprojecting with a real, analog, film projector.  It's not like you are lacking in resources if you are creating puppets like that.

When looking at both sides of this paradox, we can see the dissonance is often not where we expect it to be.  We expect the dissonance to be the thing people argue over.  Is it real or fake?  But we can see both of these perspectives are valid in their own ways.  And the mismatch is really why someone would go to so much effort to create a convincing fake, only to fall at the last hurdle.

From many other points of view - what I have outlined above is outlandish.  And in many ways, it is.  It is also a very smart strategy.  If you wanted to release evidence of unfamiliar, advanced life without causing panic, you would need to soften the blow by giving skeptics something to sink their teeth into, as to not let anything to be too credible.  A controlled shit-show.

Other examples might be the press club disclosure event, with a mix of people testifying, some credible, some not.  In a fuzzy mix of confusion you have senior military officials describing UFO's knocking out or taking over nuclear weapons facilities, at an event opened by an overly confident man bursting out into song while introducing the event.  

There is deniable credibility at every turn.
