There is one universal force - that pulls endless beauty out of the void of chaos forever.
When we create art - we align ourselves with this force, and we too pull endless beauty out of the void.

This conception of an ultimate universal force aligns with (my understanding of) Whitehead's Panexperientialist God.   

Panpsychism more broadly is seeing somewhat of a surprise uptick in popularity, coinciding with an accelerating openness to diverse perspectives exemplified in Metamodernism, Wilber's Integral consciousness, Gebser's Aperspectival consciousness, many conceptions of awakening - even the much maligned "Great Awakening".  Are we seeing a monumental shift in consciousness, some sort of trans-rational leap,  or does it just feel that way?  All of this coincidental with a seeming dawning realisation that we are not alone in the universe. 

I myself have been feeling a shift in consciousness - or the way I see the world.  It is a very disruptive and confusing process.  I think it may have to do with what McGilchrist describes as a battle between the hemispheres.  I have found myself intuiting much, much, more - letting go of the analytical critic from my left brain.  This is accompanied by an attitude shift - one where I no longer feel I need to claim some sort of ultimate truth, because no truth is ultimate.  

Instead I can hang out other perspectives and feel out what it's like.  And when you do...  look at that.... some of these perspectives that I was previously dismissing have something important to say.

There's another leap here - which I think is key.  Again, thinking about McGhilchrist - he discusses how we get stuck in black and white thinking, absolutes, and nothing is black and white.  The right brain feels the whole, the left brain categorises and chops up. Ultimate truth can only be FELT, not chopped up into words because you loose the wholeness of the truth.

So a big one here.  The categories of Real and Imaginary.

This is a black and white distinction we tend not to pay attention too.  But if you can suspend your impulse to lump experience into one of these two buckets, you can open yourself up to the lived experience of other people, with out the need to reduce and dismiss some unbelievable event into a dream, or physical reality.  A hallucination, or something nuts and bolts.  Why should we assume the world is black and white.
