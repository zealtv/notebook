This patch receives OSC data from (gyrosc)
[gyrosc](https://www.bitshapesoftware.com/instruments/gyrosc/) , and tags them with a dynamic send object to be accesed globally via named receive objects. 

Available receives are shown on the right, and useful code snippets are provided for easy patching.

The default port is 9999.
