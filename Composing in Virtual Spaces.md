## Music+

### What the hell is music anyway? 

Music infamously evades definition.   Perhaps the most often cited definition is from Edgard Var√®se:

>Music is organised sound.

Though it doesn't take long to think of examples of sound that is organised, but usually not considered music.  Think industrial noises, or the warning beeper on a backing up truck. And there are many examples of music that challenge the definition, such as aleatoric music.

Instead of asking  *What is Music?*, what if we instead consider *What is **Musical**?*

To unceremoniously paraphrase Musicologist [David Huron](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sweet-anticipation).

>Muiscality is an aesthetic sense (qualia) elicited by the subconcious recognition of temporal patterns.

  
We use our past musical experiences to build probabilistic mental models to answer the following question from moment to moment:
*Given what has happened in a piece of music thus far, and the current context, what do we expect will happen next?*

‚úÖ brain rewards itself

‚ùå brainstem reaction (arousal + positive valence)

The downstream effect is that **Predictability creates musicality.   Surprise adds excitement.** If the piece is too predictable we get bored.  If it is too difficult to predict, it doesn't sound musical.
  
Interestingly - this view of musicality is built atop predicting events in time, it is not constrained to sound.  Theoretically, other time-based artforms such as dance, poetry (*i.e. rap*), and video, could elicit musical experience.  As could natural phenomena such as a leaf falling from a tree, or a rock skipping on a lake.

  
So let's call Music+ patterns in time.  This can encapsulate composing, arranging, improvising, and performing. We often see multiple artforms and modalities presented alongside sonic musical performance.  From a music+ perspective,  all temporal (and contextual) elements of these artworks can be considered to musical elements able to be composed, arranged, performed, or improvised.

Some of my previous work has been attempting to extract the musical qualities present in other modalities - translating between vision and sound, sound and vision, motion and sound.

  

Adelaide to Melbourne - expressing audibly changes in vision over time

Luminesce - expressing visually changes in sound over time

Aileron - expressing audibly changes in position over time

  

Vision (Visual Music)

John Whitney

Jonathan Sterne's Audio-visual Litany

Michel Chion's Audio-vision and Visu-audition
 
  
* Vision
* Smell
* Touch
* Temperature
* Soma
* **Proprioception**

  
... Motion is

-> change in position over time (!)

  

Other intermodal composers often talk about sonic or visual motion (kapuscinski, whitney)

  

What is super cool about motion is we all have predictive models about the physical world - throw a ball up, we expect it to come down. This predictability gives a substrate for musical experience.

  

Ball example.

Glider example.

  

Examples of phyisics based prediction (speeding up ball on a drum)

## DYNAMIC MUSIC

* dynamic music - tracy redhead, florian thalmann
* encapsulates adaptive, generative, stochastic music and more.

  

### Tools for Dynamic Music composition

  
* Music for games is a major domain of Dynamic Music. Most common tools are FMod, and WWise.
* I wanted more granular control so I developed my own suite to realise this.

## SPATIAL METACOMPOSITION

  

Compositing for motion in digital virtual space

Distinct from Spatial Music

  

Create a multidimensional musical space.

Explore that space to render a musical result.

  

Each performance of the metacompostion may be different, so you are infact composing an infinite set of musical possiblities.

  
  

Dimensions of this compositional space do not necessarily conform to those of physical space.

Rotation example

Two dimensions of position

Change one axis to acceleration

or temperature

or character health

  

Now we are creating a generalised, multi-dimensional compositional space.

## The Hyperstave, Aileron, Elevon, and Bop

  

### The Hyperstave concept

  

### Aileron

* Limited by Abletons clipslots.

* investigated tools b composing Aileron One

  

Primary take away from this was changes in velocity can change our musical perception (unified musical time spectrum). We can manage this by bracketing velocities and composing transitions between these brackets. Akin to metric modulation.

  

*This applies to the rate of change of any continuous data source*

  

### Elevon

* Chose Pure Data because it is cross platform and embedable (raspberry pi).
* Hyperstave development became Elevon (structure)
* Music making tools became bop (content)
* Examples of bop - Elevon One

## Takeaways

  

* Musical perception can be elicited through other senses - although this may not be recognized by the experiencer.
* Musical perception is based on past experience - we can (and do) push at the boundaries of musical perception to build the basis for new musical experience (Coltrane).
* Technology opens a miriad of creative possibilities - we build upon the existing collective musical memory to slowly expand humanities palette of aesthetic experience.
* Consonance to dissonance -> Stravinsky
