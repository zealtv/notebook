In SOPHIE's Immarterial - ther are no drums, just one big, fuckoff monosynth.  There is a line of attention through out the verses that surgically leads to one big clap every 8 bars 

~~~
This is a place holder a musical analysis of how immaterial guides the listeners attention, which is the whole point of this piece of writing.

These moments of heavy percussion with a lot of weight  are sparing enough that you can preempt them, giving you enough time to through your head back a little, swing it forward and get a satisfying headbang right on the hit.  It feels fantastic. 

~~~
Headbanging is not just for metal - it's for everyone.

Another example is Charli XCX's polymetric intro in Next Level Charlli.  Not only is this rhythmically dissonant, and un expected, the BOOM BOOM slams because it so strong and confident against the weak background meter.  And you can tell that the audience FEELS it.  

The rhythmic dissonance in the polymeter is countered by the confident delivery - there could be anything in the background.  As long as it was on time

Hyperpop tugs at heart, brain and loins.

I just like this one.
