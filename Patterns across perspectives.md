Commonalities I have noticed across emerging perspectives on consciousness, reality,  aliens, and human development.

Panpsychism / Panexperientialism / Simulation
Chalmers Metaproblem, Whitehead, McGhilchrist, Metamodernism, Integral, mystics.  Spiral dynamics yellow emerging.

Aliens, mental phenomenon, the paranormal, an intelligent and aware universe.


Murky evidence of aliens suggests spatial and temporal manipulation, and an intelligence with a different relationship to time and space.

This breaks our conceptions of real and imaginary.  (John Mack, Jacque Vallee, reincarnation and simulation)


Specific, correlating examples - 
Ariel time phasing - gravity modifying movement of entities.

Gazillions of reports of missing time.  Experiences can be completely random and dream like, all the way to completely physical.  Real and imaginary is not black and white. 
 Superior entities exist outside our awareness, like the gorilla in the distraction test.  We are predictable and they are able to "step into our perception" to intervene.  Mental phenomenon is key.   Lucid dreaming and astral projection could be very significant, synchronicities, weird time perceptions.  All the weird shit.

From reports of alien contact, there is a cohesive, caring, spiritual message of oneness, with a tight correlation to reincarnation and out of body experiences.  There is quite compelling scientific evidence that reincarnation is real.

A quote from an alien relayed by contactee: "We are one with the one that is all".  Are aliens on mushrooms? Because it sure sounds like it. 

Psilocybin users reporting deep feelings of oneness, connectedness of all things.  Across the board.  Increased openness and acceptance in direct alignment with a suddenly emerging Metamodern, aperspectival perspective.  Oneness is having a real fucking moment - the universe shouting hints over the radio, like we are running out of time in an escape room.
