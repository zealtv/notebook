Continuing work on a system I was exploring earlier here
[composing with particles](composing%20with%20particles.md)

In the previous exploration I was working with TouchDesigner.  Here I have moved to Max using its native shot

After some initial experimentation with the system (which consists of several raspberry pi zeros running  [HappyBrackets](https://www.happybrackets.net/wp/), each powering two speakers ).

Initial testing has me thinking what I initially was treating as a purely generative approach, might benefit from some hands-on playability.  I am currently consider combining note input from a keyboard or grid controller, with spatial touch controls in MIRA https://cycling74.com/products/mira.  I run MIRA on a little touchscreen ultrabook via the browser and it works great.

Progress is being pushed to [github](https://github.com/zealtv/belief-control)
